#print(my_variable) #name error

#when you get an error
#1. Look at your code!
#2. Put the error and message into Google, see if something comes up in StackOverflow.
#3. Look at the code you’ve written again, this time more slowly, and run through it as if you were a computer. Do you notice anything that could potentially be a source of the error?
#4. Run only some parts of the code in isolation, that’ll help identify which part of your code is giving you an error.
#5. Use a debugger (we’ll learn how in the next couple videos).
#6. And of course, ask questions in the Course Q&A. We’re here to help!
